			<h6>July  2003.</h6>

			
<p>It was the Summer of 2003 and life was sorted back then. All I did in the day was to eat manages & it's homemade product namely pickle,aam-Panna and saved mango tree from monkies as a warrior with a club. Well, the monkies got smarter over time. They attacked the tree early morning when everyone was asleep. Nevertheless , they left enough mangoes to be savoured for humans.</p>

<p> It is not that I don't enjoy the present comforts of 24*7 electricity,electronics gadgets ,social media and technologies.I thoroughly love it.I use it. I ride it.</p>

<p>But there was a time when I had no electricity around for hours.I loved it then too. I was born in a small city of Bihar located at the bank of river Ganges ,called Bhagalpur.  Out of 24 hours we had power only some 12 hours of electricity.There wasn't any backup source at my house at that time.There were limited production of energy at power stations which had to be distributed in demographic proportion in neighbouring district viz. Sabour,Kehelgaon ,NathNagar ,Champanagar and of course Bhagalpur.
</p>

<p> Now, there are some pleasures in life that can have no substitute whatsoever.In summer there was definitely a power cut around the peak of scorching heat in the afternoon. It left us all dizzy and full of sweat.Eventually, the power came.And I used to run towards the cooler.The cool breeze and tiny water droplets from the cooler used to take all the pains inflicted due to summer. That very pleasure is inexplicable.</p>

<p>It was 8 pm night when I didn't want to study anymore. But due to the wrath of my father, I would be sitting forcefully on the wooden chair and pretended to study with full devotion.And then suddenly there is 'power cut'.Well, it was devastating for some.For example, the ones who would be watching TV like, Papa and Dadi!And the power somehow exactly went out before the climax of a particular episode of a popular TV soap.In fact, these people would sigh "Ooooh" as a display of disappointment. All "Ooooh" from neighbourhood culminated to big "OOOOOH" which was quite pleasing to my ears considering my dreadful state. But now clearly, I had a party .I was truly free in every sense for there were no lights to study.I could take all my rest and nobody could say a word to me.
</p>

<p>Every family member would creep out of the room and gather in Varanda expect Mom(she had to cook in candle light-poor Ma condolences). Dense smoke from mosquito coil (called Kachua) would rise and drive poor mosquitoes away. They weren't so poor after all. They developed immunity to the coil with time. But humans were smarter - they augmented the poison in coil and came up with the electric bat to kill them. I never understood why the top of my head was their favourite hangout spot.
</p>

<p>The radio would be tuned in to Akashwani - "Aap sunn rahe hai aakshwaani - Bhagalpur" and then play out songs older than me. Nevertheless, it was fun. I used to poke my only sibling and didn't let him be. The fireflies aka jugnu used to illuminate the bushes. Some other fireflies lead the team in producing cacophonous music. Well, that wasn't pleasing. Some of the days,I just used to gaze stars and moon and their orientation. I started counting them but always lost my number midway.
</p>

<p>Amidst all the din the power came. Most faces got all smiles. But one used to frown.
You already know who & why? ;)			</p>
